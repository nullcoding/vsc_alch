VSC RuneScape Alch Helper Tool
by Jaska BÃ¶rner (NullCoding), Abby Johnston (Azzika), and Ivan Khoprov (Sinnikkyys)
Yes, those are our real names and RuneScape display names! 

FIRST AND FOREMOST, PLEASE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS:

This program is NOT a cheat, hack, bot, script, scraper, injector, reflector, bytecode-weaver, or indeed anything else you can think of that would give the user an unfair advantage in RuneScape!

This program is also NOT a RuneScape toolkit! Though those are technically within the rules, unless of course they incorporate any of the cheating tools named above, this program does NOT interact with your RuneScape character in any way. 

In fact, it doesn't even know your character exists. It has no idea what it's called or what its levels are. For all this program knows, you don't even play RuneScape.

RuneScape is a registered trademark of JaGEx Ltd., Cambridge, Cambridgeshire and London, UK. 

All data obtained by this program has been generously made publicly available by JaGEx Ltd., and it's worth 
mentioning that the names of specific items, in addition to the terms "High Level Alchemy," "High Alch," 
"Alchemise," "Grand Exchange," and "GE" are NOT registered trademarks and are merely terms used to refer to specific parts of a larger entity called RuneScape; these terms are used to describe the intellectual property of JaGEx Ltd., not to imitate, copy, edit, or re-distribute them in any way.

Good luck trying to "re-distribute" the Grand Exchange...it's pretty sizeable.

I have to admit that we initially thought JaGEx had invented the word "alchemise," but nope, 
it's in dictionaries... :o

=====================================================

Okay, that's the copyright and liability stuff out of the way. Phew!

So then! This is an application designed solely for the purpose of determining your best chance of profiting from casting the High Level Alchemy spell on an item or many items. You can easily find the item or items which is/are currently - and I mean currently - the most profitable to alchemise based on several variables, including but not limited to the item's current market value, the price of nature runes, and the amount you can purchase in a four-hour period.

The primary purpose of this program is to prevent you from having to sift through the Grand Exchange, either ingame or on the RuneScape website, in order to find what you think might be a good thing to "alch."

It's pretty annoying having to play RuneScape with a calculator (if you're that serious about legitimate 
money-making, anyway) so we made one for you that does all the thinking. XD

This is VERY MUCH STILL IN DEVELOPMENT!! It started as an idea, evolved into a Google Spreadsheet, and now it's (almost) a working program. 

Watch this space! :)
